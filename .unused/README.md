### Config files that I don't use anymore

File | Purpose | Reason for not being used
---- | ------- | -------------------------
`Xresources` | used to load colorscheme for `xterm` | switch to `st`; less bloated, easily configurable
`Xmodmap` | custom keyboard remappings | define custom keyboard layout launched by `setxkbmap`; more stable
`vimperatorrc` | | switch to `qutebrowser`
